                <p>1. variable which is not initials will give undefined</p>
                <p>2. function with no return will give undefined</p>
                <p>3. perameters that is not passed will be undefinied</p>
                <p>4. if return has nothing on the right side will return undefined</p>
                <p>property that doesn't exist on an object will return undefined</p>
                <p> 6. accesing the elements outside of an array index range <br> will give undefined</p>

            <div class="shadow-lg p-4 my-5 rounded">
                <h4 class="py-3">How does the event loop work in JavaScript?</h4>
                <p>The Event Loop has one simple job — to monitor the Call Stack and the Callback Queue. If the Call
                    Stack is empty, the Event Loop will take the first event from the queue and will push it to the Call
                    Stack, which effectively runs it. Such an iteration is called a tick in the Event Loop.</p>

            <!--third question  -->
            <div class="shadow-lg p-4 my-5 rounded">
                <h4 class="py-3">What is the differecne between local storage and session storate in JavaScript?</h4>
                <p>sessionStorage is similar to localStorage ; the difference is that while data in localStorage doesn't
                    expire, data in sessionStorage is cleared when the page session ends. Whenever a document is loaded
                    in a particular tab in the browser, a unique page session gets created and assigned to that
                    particular tab.</p>
            </div>

            <!--fourth question  -->
            <div class="shadow-lg p-4 my-5 rounded">
                <h4 class="py-3">What is the differecne between globale scope and block scope in JavaScript?</h4>
                <p>Global scope — Global scope contains all of the things defined outside of all code blocks. A code
                    block simply consists of grouped statements inside curly braces ({ }). if statement, loops, function
                    are examples of structure that create a code block. A global variable has global scope. A global
                    variable is accessible from anywhere in the code. <br> Local Scope — Local scope contains things
                    defined
                    inside code blocks. A local variable has local scope. A local variable is only accessible where it’s
                    declared.</p>
